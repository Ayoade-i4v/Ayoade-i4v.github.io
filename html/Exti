                   <p class="Dutch">In 2011, Google introduced the Zero Moment of Truth, or ZMOT, which focuses on how consumers research online for information and make purchase decisions. A website helps your business interact with consumers at ZMOT to establish you as a credible and trustworthy business. 

                    Just like a pamphlet or a brochure, a website can share credible information about its business. Furthermore, it helps create a brand image in the eyes of new customers by showcasing your values. </p>

                    <p class="Dutch">A website enables customers to purchase from your business outside business hours. It allows you to reach consumers globally, making your website a powerful revenue channel. The website is always at work serving potential and existing customers from the comfort of their space.   </p>

                    <p class="Dutch">A website costs less to develop and maintain compared to a physical store. You can easily set up a website using low-code or no-code CMS like Webflow, Shopify, or Wix.

                        You can use your website to announce a new product or service launch, host sales, or share relevant content that benefits your customers. </p>

                    In today's digital age, a strong online presence is no longer a luxury but a necessity for stylists. Think of your website as your virtual storefront, a platform where you can showcase your skills, portfolio, and services.  A well-designed website not only attracts potential clients but also builds credibility and professionalism, setting you apart from the competition.
                    
                    
                    
                    A website allows you to control your narrative and present yourself in a way that aligns with your brand identity.  It's a space where you can showcase your unique style, share your expertise, and connect with clients on a deeper level. Imagine the power of having a platform where you can showcase your latest looks, highlight your styling philosophy, and even offer online booking options. It's a powerful tool for attracting new clients and nurturing existing ones, ultimately helping you grow your business.
